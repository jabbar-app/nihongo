# Task 31: Study Reminders Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive study reminder system using browser notifications to help users maintain consistent study habits.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
- **Migration**: `2025_10_13_035101_add_study_reminder_fields_to_user_profiles_table`
- Added fields to `user_profiles` table:
  - `study_reminder_time` (time, nullable): User's preferred reminder time
  - `study_reminders_enabled` (boolean): Whether reminders are enabled
  - `notification_permission_requested` (boolean): Tracks if permission was requested

### 2. Model Updates
- **UserProfile Model**: Added new fields to `$fillable` and `$casts` arrays
  - Properly casts boolean fields
  - Handles time field for reminder scheduling

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Study Preferences Form
- **File**: `resources/views/profile/partials/update-study-preferences-form.blade.php`
- Added reminder settings section with:
  - Checkbox to enable/disable reminders
  - Time picker for setting reminder time
  - Informational note about notification permissions
  - Alpine.js integration for dynamic form behavior
  - Permission request handling on form submission

#### Notification Service
- **File**: `resources/js/notification-service.js`
- Comprehensive JavaScript service for managing browser notifications:
  - **Permission Management**: Request and track notification permissions
  - **Scheduling**: Check every minute if it's time to show reminder
  - **Smart Notifications**: Prevents duplicate notifications on same day
  - **Daily Plan Integration**: Fetches and displays daily plan summary
  - **Snooze Functionality**: Allows users to snooze reminders
  - **Browser Compatibility**: Checks for notification support

#### Key Features:
- Singleton pattern for global access
- LocalStorage for tracking shown notifications
- Automatic initialization on page load for authenticated users
- Click handlers to navigate to study plan

### 4. Backend Components

#### ProfileController Updates
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`
- Updated `updateStudyPreferences()` method:
  - Validates new reminder fields
  - Handles checkbox conversion to boolean
  - Clears reminder time when reminders disabled

#### NotificationController
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/NotificationController.php`
- New controller with two endpoints:
  - `updatePermission()`: Tracks when user grants/denies permission
  - `dailyPlanSummary()`: Provides notification content with daily plan details

#### StudyPlanService Updates
- **File**: `app/Services/StudyPlanService.php`
- Added `getDailyPlan()` method:
  - Retrieves existing plan or generates new one
  - Used by notification system to fetch plan data

### 5. Routes
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- Added API routes:
  - `POST /api/notification-permission`: Update permission status
  - `GET /api/daily-plan-summary`: Get daily plan for notifications

### 6. Layout Integration
- **File**: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
- Added notification configuration script for authenticated users
- Passes user ID, reminder time, and enabled status to JavaScript
- Imported notification service in `resources/js/app.js`

## User Flow

### Enabling Reminders
1. User navigates to Profile â†’ Study Preferences
2. User checks "Enable daily study reminders"
3. User selects preferred reminder time
4. User clicks "Save"
5. Browser requests notification permission
6. If granted, settings are saved and reminders scheduled
7. If denied, checkbox is unchecked and user is informed

### Receiving Reminders
1. At scheduled time, notification service checks if it's time
2. Fetches daily plan summary from backend
3. Shows browser notification with:
   - Title: "Time to Study Japanese! ðŸ“š"
   - Body: Daily plan summary with activity breakdown
   - Click action: Navigate to study plan page
4. Notification auto-closes after 10 seconds
5. Tracks notification shown to prevent duplicates

### Notification Content
- Shows number of activities planned
- Breaks down by type (flashcards, exercises, shadowing)
- Displays progress if activities already completed
- Encourages user to maintain streak

## Technical Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- Checks for Notification API support
- Gracefully handles unsupported browsers
- Provides user feedback when notifications unavailable

### Privacy & Permissions
- Only requests permission when user enables reminders
- Tracks permission status in database
- Respects user's browser notification settings

### Performance
- Checks time every minute (not every second)
- Uses localStorage to prevent duplicate notifications
- Minimal API calls (only when showing notification)

### User Experience
- Clear instructions about notification permissions
- Visual feedback when settings saved
- Informative notification messages
- One-click navigation to study plan

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Enable reminders and verify permission request
2. Set reminder time to current time + 1 minute
3. Wait and verify notification appears
4. Click notification and verify navigation
5. Verify no duplicate notifications on same day
6. Test with reminders disabled
7. Test permission denial flow

### Browser Testing
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari (if available)
- Mobile browsers

### Edge Cases
- User denies permission
- User revokes permission after granting
- Browser doesn't support notifications
- User changes reminder time
- User disables then re-enables reminders
- Multiple browser tabs open

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Snooze Actions**: Add snooze button to notification
2. **Multiple Reminders**: Allow multiple reminder times per day
3. **Smart Timing**: Suggest optimal study times based on history
4. **Reminder Variations**: Different messages for different days
5. **Sound Options**: Allow users to choose notification sound
6. **Streak Warnings**: Remind users before streak breaks
7. **Achievement Notifications**: Notify when close to earning achievement
8. **Push Notifications**: Implement service worker for better reliability

### Known Limitations
1. Browser notifications require page to be loaded at least once
2. Notifications won't work if browser is completely closed
3. Some browsers block notifications in incognito mode
4. Mobile browsers may have different notification behaviors
