# Task 16: Exercise Tracking and Review Queue Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of exercise tracking and review queue functionality for the Japanese Learning Application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Exercise Tracking
- **ExerciseAttempt Model**: Tracks all exercise attempts with answers, scores, and duration
- **Automatic Tracking**: Every exercise submission is automatically saved to the database
- **Historical Data**: Complete history of all attempts with timestamps

### 2. Review Queue System
- **PhraseReviewQueue Model**: Tracks phrases that users answered incorrectly
- **Automatic Addition**: Incorrect answers automatically add related phrases to review queue
- **Incorrect Count Tracking**: Tracks how many times a phrase was answered incorrectly
- **Smart Matching**: Attempts to match incorrect answers to phrases in the lesson

### 3. Exercise History Display
- **Dedicated History Page**: `/exercises-history` route shows all exercise attempts
- **Filtering**: Can filter by lesson to see lesson-specific history
- **Average Scores**: Displays average scores by exercise type (substitution, transformation, cloze)
- **Retry Functionality**: Direct links to retry any exercise from history

### 4. Lesson Page Integration
- **Progress Statistics**: Shows total attempts and average score for each lesson
- **Per-Drill Statistics**: Displays attempt count, best score, and last score for each drill
- **Quick Access**: "View History" link to see detailed lesson-specific history

### 5. Navigation Integration
- **Main Navigation**: Added "Exercises" link to main navigation menu
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile navigation

## Database Schema

### phrase_review_queues Table
```sql
- id: bigint (PK)
- user_id: bigint (FK -> users.id)
- phrase_id: bigint (FK -> phrases.id)
- drill_id: bigint (FK -> drills.id)
- incorrect_count: int (default: 1)
- last_incorrect_at: timestamp
- reviewed_at: timestamp (nullable)
- created_at, updated_at: timestamps
- UNIQUE(user_id, phrase_id, drill_id)
```

## Controller Methods

### ExerciseController

#### `attempt(Drill $drill)`
- Alias for `show()` method
- Used to track when a user starts an exercise

#### `complete(Request $request, Drill $drill)`
- Alias for `submit()` method
- Used to track when a user completes an exercise

#### `submit(Request $request, Drill $drill)` (Enhanced)
- Validates and saves exercise answers
- Calculates score
- Tracks incorrect answers
- Adds phrases to review queue

#### `trackIncorrectAnswers(Drill $drill, array $results)` (New)
- Analyzes exercise results
- Identifies incorrect answers
- Matches incorrect answers to phrases
- Updates or creates review queue entries

#### `history(Request $request)` (New)
- Displays exercise history
- Filters by lesson if provided
- Calculates average scores by exercise type
- Paginates results (20 per page)

## Routes

```php
GET  /exercises/{drill}              - Show exercise
GET  /exercises/{drill}/attempt      - Start exercise attempt
POST /exercises/{drill}/submit       - Submit exercise answers
POST /exercises/{drill}/complete     - Complete exercise
GET  /exercises-history              - View exercise history
```

## Views

### resources/views/exercises/history.blade.php
- Displays all exercise attempts
- Shows average scores by type with color coding:
  - Green: >= 70%
  - Yellow: 50-69%
  - Red: < 50%
- Includes retry buttons for each attempt
- Empty state for users with no attempts

### resources/views/lessons/show.blade.php (Enhanced)
- Added progress statistics section in drills tab
- Shows total attempts and average score for the lesson
- Displays per-drill statistics (attempts, best score, last score)
- "View History" link to lesson-specific history

## Color Coding System

Scores are color-coded throughout the application:
- **Green (text-green-600)**: Score >= 70% (Good performance)
- **Yellow (text-yellow-600)**: Score 50-69% (Needs improvement)
- **Red (text-red-600)**: Score < 50% (Requires practice)

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Exercise History
1. Click "Exercises" in the main navigation
2. View all attempts with scores and timestamps
3. See average scores by exercise type
4. Click "Retry" to practice again

### Lesson-Specific History
1. Go to any lesson page
2. Click the "Drills" tab
3. View progress statistics at the top
4. Click "View History →" to see detailed history for that lesson

### Retry Exercises
- From history page: Click "Retry" button next to any attempt
- From lesson page: Click "Start Exercise" button on any drill

## Review Queue Integration

The review queue system is designed to:
1. Automatically identify phrases from incorrect answers
2. Track how many times each phrase was answered incorrectly
3. Store the last time the phrase was answered incorrectly
4. Provide data for future spaced repetition features

### Phrase Matching Logic
The system attempts to match incorrect answers to phrases by:
- Searching for Japanese text in the question
- Searching for English text in the question
- Searching for Romaji text in the question
- Only adding phrases from the same lesson as the drill

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future tasks:
1. **Review Queue Display**: Show users their review queue
2. **Targeted Practice**: Generate exercises from review queue phrases
3. **Progress Tracking**: Track improvement over time for specific phrases
4. **Achievements**: Award badges for consistent improvement
5. **Analytics**: Detailed charts showing performance trends

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Complete an Exercise**:
   - Navigate to any lesson
   - Click on a drill
   - Complete the exercise
   - Verify the attempt is saved

2. **View History**:
   - Click "Exercises" in navigation
   - Verify attempts are displayed
   - Check average scores are calculated correctly

3. **Retry Exercise**:
   - Click "Retry" on any attempt
   - Verify you're taken to the exercise page

4. **Lesson Statistics**:
   - Go to a lesson with completed exercises
   - Click "Drills" tab
   - Verify statistics are displayed correctly

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **3.6**: Track incorrect answers and add phrases to review queue
✅ **3.7**: Display exercise history on lesson page
✅ **3.8**: Show average score by exercise type and allow retrying exercises
