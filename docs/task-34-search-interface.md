# Task 34: Build Search Interface

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive search interface that allows users to search across all content types (phrases, dialogues, and drills) with highlighted matching text and grouped results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. SearchController
Created `app/Http/Controllers/SearchController.php`:
- `index()` method handles search requests
- Accepts query parameter `q` from GET request
- Measures search execution time in milliseconds
- Returns search results grouped by content type
- Passes query, results, and search time to view

### 2. Search Bar in Navigation
Updated `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`:
- Added search bar between navigation links and settings dropdown
- Desktop version: Full-width search input with icon
- Mobile version: Collapsible search bar in responsive menu
- Search icon (magnifying glass) positioned on the left
- Placeholder text guides users on what they can search
- Maintains search query value after submission

### 3. Search Results View
Created `resources/views/search/index.blade.php`:
- **Search Summary**: Displays total results count, query, and search time
- **Grouped Results**: Results organized by type (Phrases, Dialogues, Drills)
- **Highlighted Matches**: Query text highlighted with yellow background
- **Result Cards**: Each result displayed in a card with hover effects
- **Lesson Context**: Shows which lesson each result belongs to
- **Type Icons**: Visual icons for each content type
- **No Results State**: Helpful message when no results found
- **Empty State**: Guidance when no query entered

### 4. Result Display Features

#### Phrases Results
- Japanese text, romaji, and English translation
- Notes displayed if available
- Lesson badge showing source lesson
- Link to lesson's phrases section

#### Dialogues Results
- Dialogue title
- Preview of first 3 lines with speaker labels
- Indicator for additional lines
- Lesson badge showing source lesson
- Link to lesson's dialogues section

#### Drills Results
- Drill title and type badge (substitution, transformation, cloze)
- Content preview (first 150 characters)
- Lesson badge showing source lesson
- Link to exercise page

### 5. Highlighting Implementation
- Uses `str_ireplace()` for case-insensitive highlighting
- Wraps matching text in `<mark>` tag with yellow background
- Applied to all searchable fields (Japanese, romaji, English, notes, titles, content)

### 6. Routes
Added to `routes/web.php`:
```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/search', [\App\Http\Controllers\SearchController::class, 'index'])->name('search.index');
});
```

## User Experience

### Search Flow
1. User enters search query in navigation bar
2. Submits form (Enter key or click search)
3. Redirected to search results page
4. Results displayed grouped by type
5. Click any result to navigate to source content

### Visual Design
- Clean, card-based layout
- Color-coded by content type:
  - Phrases: Indigo
  - Dialogues: Green
  - Drills: Purple
- Hover effects on result cards
- Yellow highlighting for matched text
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Performance
- Search time displayed in milliseconds
- Efficient database queries via SearchService
- Results limited to relevant content only

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Search for Japanese text (e.g., "こんにちは")
2. Search for romaji (e.g., "konnichiwa")
3. Search for English text (e.g., "hello")
4. Search for partial matches
5. Test empty search
6. Test search with no results
7. Verify highlighting works correctly
8. Test navigation to source content
9. Test on mobile devices
10. Verify search bar in responsive menu

### Edge Cases
- Empty query handling
- Special characters in search
- Very long search queries
- Case sensitivity (should be case-insensitive)
- Multiple word searches

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **8.1**: Search across all lesson content (phrases, dialogues, drills)
✅ **8.2**: Display results showing matching content with lesson context and content type
✅ **8.3**: Navigate to specific lesson section containing content
✅ **8.6**: Highlight matching text in results
