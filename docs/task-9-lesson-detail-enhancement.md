## Technical Implementation Details

### Controller Updates

```php
// Added to LessonController@show
$userProgress = $user->progress()->where('lesson_id', $lesson->id)->first();
$speakingTimePracticed = round(
    $user->studyActivities()
        ->where('activityable_type', Lesson::class)
        ->where('activityable_id', $lesson->id)
        ->whereIn('activity_type', ['dialogue_practice', 'shadowing_practice'])
        ->sum('duration_seconds') / 60,
    1
);
$estimatedTime = ($lesson->dialogues->count() * 3) + ($lesson->shadowingExercises->count() * 5);
```

### Design System Consistency

All components follow the established design system:
- **Colors**: Indigo (primary), Purple (shadowing), Green (success), Yellow (warning), Red (error)
- **Spacing**: Consistent use of Tailwind spacing scale
- **Typography**: Japanese text at 1.125rem, body text at 1rem
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px height for mobile
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions (150-300ms)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- **Mobile**: Single column, stacked layouts, larger touch targets
- **Tablet**: Two-column grids where appropriate
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layouts, side-by-side elements

### Performance Considerations

- Cached lesson data (1 hour TTL)
- Efficient database queries with eager loading
- CSS animations (no JavaScript required for confetti)
- Lazy loading for heavy components
