**Location:** `resources/views/profile/partials/achievement-showcase.blade.php`

**Features:**
- Achievement cards with hover lift effect
- Card hover shadow animation
- Achievement icons with bounce-in animation
- Stats card with hover lift

**Components:**
- Achievement notification toast (slide-in from right)
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Celebration animations on unlock

### 6. Hover Effects on Interactive Elements
**Locations:** Multiple views

**Applied to:**
- Dashboard stat cards (hover-lift, card-hover)
- Lesson cards (hover-lift, card-hover)
- Achievement cards (hover-lift, card-hover)
- Buttons throughout the app (btn-press)

**CSS Classes:**

**Location:** `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

**Features:**
- Smooth opacity transitions between pages
- 300ms duration with ease-in-out timing

**CSS Class:** `.page-transition`

### 8. Additional Utility Animations

**Pulse Animation:**
- `.pulse-slow` - Slow pulsing for loading states

**Shake Animation:**
- `.shake` - Error feedback animation

**Slide Animations:**
- `.slide-in-bottom` - Slide from bottom
- `.slide-in-top` - Slide from top

## CSS Animation Definitions

All animations are defined in `resources/css/app.css` with the following keyframes:

1. **progressGrow** - Progress bar growth animation
2. **spin** - Loading spinner rotation
3. **fadeIn** - Fade entrance
4. **slideInBottom** - Slide from bottom
5. **slideInTop** - Slide from top
6. **bounceIn** - Bounce entrance with scale
7. **shake** - Horizontal shake for errors
8. **glow** - Pulsing glow effect
9. **celebrate** - Wiggle/shake celebration

## Performance Considerations

- All animations use CSS transforms and opacity for GPU acceleration
- Animations are kept subtle (< 1 second duration)
- No animations on reduced-motion preference (can be added)
- Confetti animation stops after 5 seconds to save resources
- Loading spinners only appear during actual async operations

## Accessibility

- All animations respect semantic HTML
- ARIA labels added to loading states
- Screen reader announcements for important state changes
- Keyboard navigation unaffected by animations
- Visual feedback doesn't rely solely on animation

## Browser Compatibility

- CSS animations supported in all modern browsers
- Fallback to instant transitions in older browsers
- Canvas-based confetti works in all browsers with canvas support
- Alpine.js transitions provide cross-browser consistency

## Usage Examples

### Using Loading Spinner
```blade
<x-loading-spinner size="md" text="Loading..." />
```

### Applying Hover Effects
```blade
<div class="hover-lift card-hover">
    <!-- Card content -->
</div>
```

### Progress Bar
```blade
<div class="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
    <div class="bg-blue-600 h-2 rounded-full progress-bar" 
         style="width: {{ $percentage }}%"></div>
</div>
```

### Achievement Notification
```blade
<x-achievement-notification :achievement="$achievement" />
```
