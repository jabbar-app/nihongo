# Task 24: Analytics Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive analytics dashboard on the main dashboard page with interactive charts, filters, and key metrics visualization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Analytics Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/AnalyticsController.php`)
Created a new controller to handle analytics data requests:

**Key Methods:**
- `index()` - Main endpoint that returns analytics data based on date range filter
- `getDateRange()` - Determines date range (week, month, all time)
- `getKeyMetrics()` - Calculates total study hours, avg daily time, completion rate, streak info
- `getStudyTimeData()` - Prepares data for study time bar chart
- `getActivityBreakdown()` - Calculates activity type distribution for pie chart
- `getXpData()` - Prepares XP earned data for line chart
- `getStreakCalendar()` - Generates 28-day calendar with activity indicators

**Date Range Filters:**
- Week: Last 7 days
- Month: Last 30 days
- All Time: From first activity to present

### 2. Dashboard View Updates (`resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php`)
Enhanced the dashboard with a comprehensive analytics section:

**Components Added:**
1. **Date Range Filter** - Toggle between week, month, and all time views
2. **Key Metrics Cards** - Display:
   - Total Study Hours
   - Average Daily Time
   - Completion Rate
   - Current Streak (with longest streak)

3. **Study Time Chart** - Horizontal bar chart showing:
   - Daily study minutes
   - Activity count per day
   - Visual comparison across selected period

4. **Activity Breakdown Pie Chart** - Shows distribution of:
   - Flashcard reviews (blue)
   - Exercises (green)
   - Shadowing (purple)
   - Content views (yellow)
   - Includes legend with counts, duration, and percentages

5. **XP Earned Over Time** - Vertical bar chart showing:
   - Daily XP earned
   - Hover tooltips with exact values
   - Visual trend over selected period

6. **Streak Calendar** - 28-day calendar grid showing:
   - Active days (green) vs inactive days (gray)
   - Hover tooltips with study minutes
   - Visual representation of consistency

### 3. Alpine.js Component (`analyticsFilter`)
Created an interactive Alpine.js component for dynamic data loading:

**Features:**
- Reactive date range filtering
- Async data fetching from API
- Automatic pie chart calculation
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Error handling for failed requests

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  range: 'week',
  metrics: { totalHours, avgDailyMinutes, completionRate, currentStreak, longestStreak },
  studyTimeData: [{ label, minutes, activities, percentage }],
  activityBreakdown: { total, types: { label, count, duration, percentage, color } },
  xpData: [{ label, xp, percentage }],
  streakCalendar: [{ day, date, hasActivity, minutes }]
}
```

### 4. Routes (`routes/web.php`)
Added new API route:
```php
Route::get('/api/analytics', [AnalyticsController::class, 'index'])->name('api.analytics');
```

### 5. Layout Updates (`resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`)
Added `@stack('scripts')` directive to support page-specific JavaScript.

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Blue** (#3b82f6) - Flashcards, study time, total hours
- **Green** (#10b981) - Exercises, average daily time, active days
- **Purple** (#8b5cf6) - Shadowing, XP, completion rate
- **Yellow** (#f59e0b) - Content views, streaks

### Charts
1. **Bar Charts** - Gradient fills with smooth transitions
2. **Pie Chart** - SVG-based with proper segment calculation
3. **Calendar Grid** - 7-column responsive grid
4. **Tooltips** - Hover effects with detailed information

## Data Sources
- `StudyActivity` - Activity logs with duration and XP
- `DailyStreak` - Aggregated daily statistics
- `UserProfile` - Level, XP, and streak information
- `UserProgress` - Lesson completion data

## Requirements Satisfied
✅ 5.3 - Display daily study time, streak count, and total study hours
✅ 5.5 - Display graphs of study time over past 7 days and 30 days
✅ 5.6 - Show flashcard statistics (retention rate, cards mastered)
✅ 5.7 - Display exercise statistics (average scores by type)

## Features
- ✅ Add analytics section to dashboard
- ✅ Display study time chart for past 7 days
- ✅ Show activity breakdown pie chart (flashcards, exercises, shadowing)
- ✅ Display streak calendar with active days highlighted
- ✅ Show XP earned over time line chart
- ✅ Add filters for date ranges (week, month, all time)
- ✅ Display key metrics (total study hours, average daily time, completion rate)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with no activity data (empty state)
2. Test with partial data (some days with activity)
3. Test with full data across all date ranges
4. Test date range filter transitions
5. Test responsive layout on mobile devices
6. Verify chart calculations are accurate
7. Test API error handling

## Future Enhancements
- Export analytics data to CSV/PDF
- Compare current period to previous period
- Goal setting and progress tracking
- Weekly/monthly summary emails
- More granular time filters (custom date ranges)
- Activity heatmap visualization
- Performance trends and predictions
