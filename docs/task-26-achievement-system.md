# Task 26: Achievement System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive achievement system that tracks user progress and awards achievements with bonus XP for various milestones.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Achievement Seeder
Created `database/seeders/AchievementSeeder.php` with 28 predefined achievements across multiple categories:

#### Achievement Categories:
- **Flashcard Achievements**: First card, 10 cards, 100 cards, 500 cards, 1000 cards
- **Streak Achievements**: 3-day, 7-day, 30-day, 100-day, 365-day streaks
- **Lesson Completion**: First lesson, 3 lessons, all 9 lessons
- **Exercise Achievements**: First exercise, 10 exercises, 50 exercises, perfect score
- **Shadowing Achievements**: First shadowing, 10 shadowings, 50 shadowings
- **Study Time**: 1 hour, 10 hours, 50 hours, 100 hours total
- **Level Milestones**: Level 5, 10, 25, 50

Each achievement includes:
- Unique slug identifier
- Display name and description
- Icon emoji
- XP reward (10-5000 XP)
- Requirement type and value

### 2. GamificationService Enhancement
Added `checkAchievements()` method to `app/Services/GamificationService.php`:

**Features:**
- Checks all achievements against user's current progress
- Awards newly earned achievements automatically
- Updates progress for unearned achievements
- Awards bonus XP when achievements are unlocked
- Prevents duplicate achievement awards
- Returns collection of newly earned achievements

**Progress Calculation:**
The service calculates progress for different achievement types:
- `flashcard_reviews`: Count of all flashcard reviews
- `streak`: Current streak from user profile
- `lessons_completed`: Lessons with 100% completion
- `exercises_completed`: Count of exercise attempts
- `perfect_exercise`: Exercises with 100% score
- `shadowing_completed`: Count of shadowing completions
- `study_minutes`: Total study time in minutes
- `level`: Current user level

### 3. Observer Integration
Updated all activity observers to automatically check achievements:

**Modified Observers:**
- `FlashcardReviewObserver`: Checks achievements after each review
- `ExerciseAttemptObserver`: Checks achievements after exercise completion
- `ShadowingCompletionObserver`: Checks achievements after shadowing

This ensures achievements are awarded in real-time as users complete activities.

### 4. User Model Enhancement
Added `flashcardReviews()` relationship to `app/Models/User.php`:
```php
public function flashcardReviews()
{
    return $this->hasManyThrough(FlashcardReview::class, Flashcard::class);
}
```

This enables efficient querying of all reviews across a user's flashcards.

### 5. Database Seeder Update
Updated `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` to include `AchievementSeeder` in the default seeding process.

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/AchievementSystemTest.php`:

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ Achievements are seeded correctly
2. ✅ First flashcard review achievement is awarded
3. ✅ Exercise completion achievement is awarded
4. ✅ Perfect score achievement is awarded
5. ✅ Shadowing achievement is awarded
6. ✅ Bonus XP is awarded for achievement unlocks
7. ✅ Same achievement is not awarded twice
8. ✅ Progress is tracked for unearned achievements

All tests passing (8 passed, 19 assertions).

## Usage

### Seeding Achievements
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AchievementSeeder
```

### Manual Achievement Check
```php
$gamificationService = app(GamificationService::class);
$newAchievements = $gamificationService->checkAchievements($user);

foreach ($newAchievements as $achievement) {
    // Display achievement notification
    echo "Unlocked: {$achievement->name}";
}
```

### Checking User Achievements
```php
// Get all earned achievements
$earned = $user->achievements()
    ->wherePivotNotNull('earned_at')
    ->get();

// Get achievements in progress
$inProgress = $user->achievements()
    ->wherePivotNull('earned_at')
    ->where('progress', '>', 0)
    ->get();
```

## XP Rewards

Achievement XP rewards range from 10 to 5000 XP:
- Basic achievements (first actions): 10-30 XP
- Milestone achievements: 50-300 XP
- Major achievements (streaks, completions): 500-1000 XP
- Epic achievements (365-day streak, level 50): 5000 XP

## Database Schema

The achievement system uses existing tables:
- `achievements`: Stores achievement definitions
- `user_achievements`: Pivot table tracking user progress and earned status
  - `progress`: Current progress toward achievement
  - `earned_at`: Timestamp when achievement was earned (null if not earned)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future tasks:
1. Achievement notification UI with celebration animations
2. Achievement showcase on user profile
3. Social features (share achievements)
4. Seasonal/limited-time achievements
5. Achievement categories and filters
6. Leaderboards based on achievements

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies requirements:
- 7.4: Achievement system with milestone tracking
- 7.5: Achievement unlocking based on user activities
- 7.6: Achievement display and progress tracking
- 7.7: Streak-based achievements
- 7.8: Bonus XP for achievement unlocks
