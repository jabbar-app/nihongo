# Task 28: Level-Up Celebrations Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive level-up celebration system that displays animated modals when users level up, tracks level-up history, and awards bonus XP for milestone levels.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Migration**: `create_level_ups_table`
  - Tracks all level-up events with old/new levels
  - Records XP at level-up and any bonus XP awarded
  - Indexed for efficient querying by user and date

### 2. Models
- **LevelUp Model** (`app/Models/LevelUp.php`)
  - Stores level-up history for each user
  - Relationships: belongs to User
  - Tracks: old_level, new_level, xp_at_levelup, bonus_xp

### 3. Service Updates
- **GamificationService** (`app/Services/GamificationService.php`)
  - Updated `awardXP()` to return level-up data when user levels up
  - Added `getMilestoneBonusXp()` for milestone level bonuses:
    - Level 10: 500 bonus XP
    - Level 25: 1000 bonus XP
    - Level 50: 2500 bonus XP
  - Added `getUnlockedFeatures()` to show features unlocked at each level
  - Creates LevelUp records automatically when users level up

### 4. UI Components
- **Level-Up Modal** (`resources/views/components/level-up-modal.blade.php`)
  - Animated celebration modal with confetti effect
  - Displays new level, XP earned, and bonus XP
  - Shows unlocked features for the new level
  - Plays sound effect on level-up
  - Auto-dismisses confetti after 5 seconds
  - Fully responsive design

- **Level-Up History** (`resources/views/profile/partials/level-up-history.blade.php`)
  - Shows last 10 level-ups on profile page
  - Displays level progression, XP earned, and timestamps
  - Highlights milestone level-ups with special badges
  - Shows relative time (e.g., "2 days ago")

### 5. Observer Updates
Updated all activity observers to handle level-ups:
- **FlashcardReviewObserver**: Stores level-up data in session
- **ExerciseAttemptObserver**: Stores level-up data in session
- **ShadowingCompletionObserver**: Stores level-up data in session

### 6. Layout Integration
- Added level-up modal to main app layout
- Modal automatically shows when level-up data is in session
- Works across all authenticated pages

## Features

### Celebration Modal
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Confetti animation with colorful particles
  - Bouncing trophy icon
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Smooth transitions and animations

- **Information Displayed**:
  - Old level → New level progression
  - XP earned from the activity
  - Bonus XP for milestone levels
  - List of unlocked features
  - Motivational messaging

- **Interactions**:
  - Click backdrop or close button to dismiss
  - Keyboard-friendly (ESC to close)
  - Touch-friendly for mobile devices

### Milestone Bonuses
- **Level 10**: 500 bonus XP + Custom study plans unlocked
- **Level 25**: 1000 bonus XP + Master learner status
- **Level 50**: 2500 bonus XP + Legend status

### Level-Up History
- Chronological list of all level-ups
- Shows progression path
- Highlights milestone achievements
- Displays exact dates and relative times
- Limited to 10 most recent (with count of total)

## Technical Implementation

### Confetti Animation
- Canvas-based particle system
- 100 particles with random colors
- Physics simulation (gravity, tilt, rotation)
- Automatically stops after 5 seconds
- Performance optimized with requestAnimationFrame

### Sound Effect
- Web Audio API for level-up sound
- Simple sine wave beep
- Graceful fallback if audio not supported
- Non-blocking (doesn't interrupt user)

### Session Management
- Level-up data stored in flash session
- Automatically cleared after display
- Works with page redirects
- No database queries needed for display

### Alpine.js Integration
- Reactive modal component
- Event-driven architecture
- Custom event listener for programmatic triggers
- Clean state management

## User Experience

### Flow
1. User completes an activity (flashcard review, exercise, shadowing)
2. XP is awarded through observer
3. If level-up occurs, data is stored in session
4. On next page load, modal automatically appears
5. Confetti animation plays
6. User sees new level and unlocked features
7. User clicks "Continue Learning" to dismiss
8. Level-up is recorded in history

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly labels
- High contrast colors
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum)

### Responsive Design
- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Scales appropriately for screen size
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Readable text at all sizes

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Create a new user and complete activities to earn XP
2. Verify modal appears when leveling up
3. Check confetti animation plays
4. Verify sound effect (if browser supports)
5. Test milestone bonuses at levels 10, 25, 50
6. Check level-up history on profile page
7. Test on different screen sizes
8. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, ESC)

### Automated Testing
```php
// Test level-up detection
$user = User::factory()->create();
$service = app(GamificationService::class);

// Award enough XP to level up
$levelUpData = $service->awardXP($user, 100, 'Test');

$this->assertNotNull($levelUpData);
$this->assertEquals(2, $levelUpData['new_level']);
$this->assertEquals(1, $levelUpData['old_level']);

// Test milestone bonus
$user->profile->update(['total_xp' => 2650, 'level' => 9]);
$levelUpData = $service->awardXP($user, 50, 'Test');

$this->assertEquals(10, $levelUpData['new_level']);
$this->assertEquals(500, $levelUpData['bonus_xp']);
```
