# Task 20: Track Shadowing Completions - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive shadowing completion tracking with progress updates, XP rewards, and completion history display.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Services Created

#### ProgressService (`app/Services/ProgressService.php`)
- **updateShadowingProgress()**: Updates user progress when shadowing exercise is completed

- **getOverallProgress()**: Returns overall progress across all lessons

#### GamificationService (`app/Services/GamificationService.php`)
- **awardXP()**: Awards experience points to users for completing activities
- **calculateLevel()**: Calculates user level based on total XP
- **getXpForNextLevel()**: Returns XP required for next level
- **checkLevelUp()**: Checks if user has leveled up
- **getLevelProgress()**: Returns detailed level progress information

**XP Rewards:**
- Shadowing Completion: 50 XP
- Flashcard Review: 5 XP
- Exercise Completion: 30 XP
- Lesson Completion: 100 XP

**Level Thresholds:**
- Level 1: 0 XP
- Level 2: 100 XP
- Level 3: 250 XP
- Level 4: 500 XP
- Level 5: 1000 XP
- Level 6: 1500 XP
- Level 7: 2500 XP
- Level 8: 4000 XP
- Level 9: 6000 XP
- Level 10: 8500 XP

### 2. Controller Updates

#### ShadowingController (`app/Http/Controllers/ShadowingController.php`)
- Added dependency injection for ProgressService and GamificationService
- **show()**: Enhanced to load completions with recording relationships
- **complete()**: New method to handle shadowing exercise completion
  - Validates duration and optional recording ID
  - Creates ShadowingCompletion record
  - Awards XP (50 points)
  - Logs StudyActivity
  - Updates lesson progress
  - Checks for level up
  - Returns JSON response with success status and XP earned

### 3. Routes Added

```php
POST /shadowing/{shadowingExercise}/complete
```

### 4. View Enhancements

#### Shadowing Exercise View (`resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php`)

**Added Sections:**

1. **Mark as Complete Section**
   - Duration input field (in minutes)
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Success message showing XP earned and level up notification
   - Error message handling

2. **Completion History Section**
   - Displays all past completions for the exercise
   - Shows completion date and time
   - Displays practice duration
   - Links to associated recordings (if available)
   - Shows XP earned badge (+50 XP)
   - Formatted with relative timestamps

**Alpine.js Component:**
- `completionTracker`: Handles completion form submission
  - Manages form state (duration, submitting, messages)
  - Sends POST request to completion endpoint
  - Displays success/error messages
  - Auto-reloads page after successful completion

### 5. Database Integration

**Tables Used:**
- `shadowing_completions`: Stores completion records
- `study_activities`: Logs all study activities
- `user_progress`: Tracks lesson progress
- `user_profiles`: Stores XP and level data

**Relationships:**
- ShadowingCompletion → User
- ShadowingCompletion → ShadowingExercise
- ShadowingCompletion → UserRecording (optional)
- StudyActivity → User
- StudyActivity → ShadowingCompletion (polymorphic)

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Create ShadowingCompletion records on exercise completion
- Records created with user_id, exercise_id, duration, recording_id, and timestamp

### ✅ Track duration and link to recording if available
- Duration stored in seconds
- Optional recording_id links to saved audio recordings

### ✅ Update lesson progress when shadowing exercise completed
- Increments shadowing_completed count in UserProgress
- Recalculates completion_percentage based on all activity types
- Updates last_accessed_at timestamp

### ✅ Display completion status on lesson shadowing tab
- Shows completion count prominently at top of page
- Displays last completion time
- Green gradient background for visual feedback

### ✅ Show completion history with dates and durations
- Lists all completions in reverse chronological order
- Shows formatted dates and relative timestamps
- Displays practice duration for each completion
- Links to associated recordings

### ✅ Award XP for shadowing practice
- Awards 50 XP per completion
- Logs activity in study_activities table
- Checks for level up after XP award
- Displays XP earned in success message
- Shows level up notification if applicable

## Progress Calculation

Lesson progress is calculated using weighted averages:
- Phrases viewed: 25%
- Dialogues viewed: 25%
- Drills completed: 25%
- Shadowing completed: 25%

Each activity type contributes equally to overall lesson completion.

## User Experience Flow

1. User practices shadowing exercise
2. User enters practice duration (in minutes)
3. User clicks "Mark as Complete"
4. System:
   - Creates completion record
   - Awards 50 XP
   - Updates lesson progress
   - Checks for level up
   - Logs study activity
5. Success message displays XP earned and level up (if applicable)
6. Page reloads to show updated completion history
7. Completion appears in history with date, duration, and XP badge

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Shadowing exercise completed!",
  "xp_earned": 50,
  "level_up": 3,  // null if no level up
  "completion": {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "shadowing_exercise_id": 1,
    "duration_seconds": 900,
    "recording_id": null,
    "completed_at": "2025-01-10T12:00:00.000000Z",
    "recording": null
  }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Navigate to a shadowing exercise
   - Enter practice duration
   - Click "Mark as Complete"
   - Verify XP is awarded
   - Check completion appears in history
   - Verify lesson progress updates

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Complete same exercise multiple times
   - Complete with and without recordings
   - Test with various durations
   - Verify level up notifications
   - Check progress calculation accuracy

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Verify progress updates across lessons
   - Test XP accumulation and leveling
   - Check study activity logging
   - Validate completion history display

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **Requirement 4.5**: Track shadowing session duration and completion
- ✅ **Requirement 4.7**: Update lesson progress when shadowing exercise completed
- ✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Log study activities for progress tracking

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Daily streak tracking (Task 21+)
- Achievement system integration (Task 25+)
- Analytics dashboard (Task 24)
- Study plan generation (Task 29+)

All services are ready to be used by future tasks for comprehensive progress tracking and gamification features.
