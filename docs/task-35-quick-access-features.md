# Task 35: Quick Access Features Implementation

## Overview
Implemented quick access features including recently viewed tracking, bookmarks, continue learning button, and breadcrumb navigation to improve user navigation and content discovery.

## Components Implemented

### 1. RecentlyViewedService
**Location:** `app/Services/RecentlyViewedService.php`

A service that tracks user content views using Laravel's cache system:
- Tracks views for lessons, phrases, dialogues, drills, and shadowing exercises
- Stores up to 10 recent items per user with 24-hour cache TTL
- Provides methods to retrieve recent items with loaded models
- Supports getting the last viewed item of a specific type

**Key Methods:**
- `trackView(User $user, string $type, int $id, array $metadata)` - Track a content view
- `getRecentItems(User $user, int $limit = 5)` - Get recent items as array
- `getRecentItemsWithModels(User $user, int $limit = 5)` - Get recent items with loaded models
- `getLastViewedOfType(User $user, string $type)` - Get last viewed item of specific type

### 2. Bookmark System

#### Database
**Migration:** `database/migrations/2025_10_13_044554_create_bookmarks_table.php`

Creates `bookmarks` table with:
- Polymorphic relationship (bookmarkable_type, bookmarkable_id)
- User relationship
- Optional notes field
- Unique constraint per user/content combination
- Indexes for performance

#### Models
**Bookmark Model:** `app/Models/Bookmark.php`
- Polymorphic relationship to bookmarkable content
- Belongs to User

**User Model:** Updated to include `bookmarks()` relationship

#### Controller
**BookmarkController:** `app/Http/Controllers/BookmarkController.php`

**Routes:**
- `GET /bookmarks` - Display all bookmarks
- `POST /bookmarks/toggle` - Toggle bookmark on/off (AJAX)
- `PATCH /bookmarks/{bookmark}/notes` - Update bookmark notes
- `DELETE /bookmarks/{bookmark}` - Remove bookmark

**Methods:**
- `index()` - Display bookmarks grouped by type
- `toggle(Request $request)` - Toggle bookmark via AJAX
- `updateNotes(Request $request, Bookmark $bookmark)` - Update notes
- `destroy(Bookmark $bookmark)` - Delete bookmark

#### Policy
**BookmarkPolicy:** `app/Policies/BookmarkPolicy.php`
- Ensures users can only update/delete their own bookmarks

#### Views
**Bookmarks Index:** `resources/views/bookmarks/index.blade.php`
- Displays bookmarks grouped by content type
- Shows content details and links to original content
- Displays bookmark notes if present
- Shows when bookmarked
- Delete button for each bookmark
- Empty state with call-to-action

### 3. UI Components

#### Bookmark Button Component
**Location:** `resources/views/components/bookmark-button.blade.php`

Reusable Alpine.js component for bookmarking content:
- Toggle bookmark state with visual feedback
- Shows filled/unfilled bookmark icon
- AJAX request to toggle bookmark
- Loading state during request
- Props: `type`, `id`, `bookmarked`

**Usage:**
```blade
<x-bookmark-button type="lesson" :id="$lesson->id" :bookmarked="$isBookmarked" />
```

#### Breadcrumb Component
**Location:** `resources/views/components/breadcrumb.blade.php`

Navigation breadcrumb component:
- Shows hierarchical navigation path
- Home icon for dashboard link
- Supports multiple levels
- Last item is not clickable (current page)
- Responsive design

**Usage:**
```blade
<x-breadcrumb :items="[
    ['label' => 'Lessons', 'url' => route('lessons.index')],
    ['label' => $lesson->title]
]" />
```

### 4. Dashboard Enhancements

Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/bookmarks', [BookmarkController::class, 'index'])->name('bookmarks.index');
    Route::post('/bookmarks/toggle', [BookmarkController::class, 'toggle'])->name('bookmarks.toggle');

## Future Enhancements
