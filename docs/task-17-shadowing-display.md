# Task 17: Shadowing Exercise Display Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive shadowing exercise display system that allows users to practice Japanese pronunciation and listening through interactive audio playback with synchronized script display.

## Components Created

### 1. ShadowingController (`app/Http/Controllers/ShadowingController.php`)
- `show()` method that displays a specific shadowing exercise
- Loads exercise with lesson relationship
- Retrieves user's completion history
- Passes completion statistics to the view

### 2. Shadowing Exercise View (`resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php`)
Comprehensive view with the following features:

#### Header Section
- Back navigation to lesson
- Exercise title and lesson information
- Duration display (if available)

#### Progress Stats
- Completion count display
- Last practice timestamp
- Conditional display (only shown if user has completions)

#### Instructions Panel
- Clear shadowing instructions
- Best practices for effective practice
- Visual icon for better UX

#### Audio Player Component (Alpine.js)
**Features:**
- Play/Pause/Stop controls
- Progress bar showing current line position
- Playback speed control (0.5x to 1.5x)
- Loop functionality for repeated practice
- Line counter (current/total)

**Implementation:**
- Uses Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- Japanese language support (`ja-JP`)
- Automatic progression through lines
- Configurable pause between lines (500ms)
- Error handling for speech synthesis issues

#### Script Display
- Line-by-line display with numbered cards
- Click-to-play individual lines
- Visual highlighting of current line during playback
- Supports multiple content formats:
  - `line` field (from current data structure)
  - `japanese` field (alternative format)
  - `text` field (fallback)
- Optional fields displayed when available:
  - Romaji pronunciation
  - English translation
  - Speaker identification

#### Practice Tips Section
- Four key practice tips in a grid layout
- Visual checkmarks for better readability
- Responsive design (1 column on mobile, 2 on desktop)

### 3. Route Configuration
Added shadowing route to `routes/web.php`:
```php
Route::get('/shadowing/{shadowingExercise}', [ShadowingController::class, 'show'])
    ->name('shadowing.show');
```

### 4. Lesson View Integration
Updated `resources/views/lessons/show.blade.php` shadowing tab:
- Added "Practice" button linking to shadowing exercise
- Display exercise metadata (duration, line count)
- Show completion statistics
- Display last practice timestamp
- Improved visual design with hover effects

## Technical Details

### Alpine.js Component: `shadowingPlayer`
**Data Properties:**
- `lines`: Array of script lines
- `currentLineIndex`: Current line being played
- `isPlaying`: Playback state
- `loopEnabled`: Loop mode state
- `playbackRate`: Speed multiplier (0.5-1.5)
- `utterance`: SpeechSynthesisUtterance instance
- `synth`: Web Speech API reference

**Methods:**
- `playPause()`: Toggle playback
- `play()`: Start playback from current position
- `pause()`: Pause playback
- `stop()`: Stop and reset to beginning
- `playLine(index)`: Play specific line
- `playCurrentLine()`: Play current line with TTS
- `nextLine()`: Advance to next line
- `toggleLoop()`: Toggle loop mode
- `changeSpeed(rate)`: Change playback speed

**Computed Properties:**
- `progress`: Percentage of completion (0-100)

### Content Structure Support
The implementation supports flexible content structures:
```javascript
// Primary format (current database structure)
{ line: "Japanese text", speaker: "Speaker name" }

// Alternative formats
{ japanese: "Japanese text", romaji: "Romaji", english: "English" }
{ text: "Japanese text" }
```

## User Experience Features

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Current line highlighted with indigo background
   - Numbered line indicators change color during playback
   - Progress bar shows overall completion
   - Hover effects on interactive elements

2. **Accessibility**
   - Click any line to play it directly
   - Keyboard-friendly controls
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

3. **Practice Optimization**
   - Adjustable playback speed for beginners
   - Loop mode for repetitive practice
   - Individual line playback for focused practice
   - Automatic progression through script

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Completion count display
   - Last practice timestamp
   - Integration with existing completion system

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **4.1**: Audio playback with text-to-speech  
✅ **4.2**: Playback controls (play, pause, seek via line selection)  
✅ **4.6**: Script display with line-by-line content  
✅ **4.7**: Completion tracking display  
✅ **4.8**: Playback speed control (0.5x-1.5x)

## Future Enhancements (Not in Current Task)
- Audio recording functionality (Task 18)
- Recording storage and playback (Task 19)
- Completion tracking with XP awards (Task 20)
- Actual audio file support (currently using TTS)
- Waveform visualization
- Pronunciation feedback

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with different shadowing exercises
2. Verify playback speed changes work correctly
3. Test loop functionality
4. Verify line highlighting during playback
5. Test on mobile devices for responsive design
6. Test with screen readers for accessibility
7. Verify completion statistics display correctly
