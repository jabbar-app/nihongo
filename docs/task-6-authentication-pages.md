## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `lang/en/validation.php` - Custom validation messages
- `resources/js/formValidation.js` - Inline validation enhancement
- `docs/task-6-authentication-pages.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` - Redesigned login page
- `resources/views/auth/register.blade.php` - Redesigned registration page
- `resources/views/components/input-error.blade.php` - Enhanced error display

## Next Steps

The authentication pages are now complete with speaking-focused messaging and improved validation. The next task in the implementation plan is:

**Task 7: Redesign dashboard with speaking personalization**

This will involve:
- Creating personalized greeting section
- Building speaking metrics cards
- Creating quick actions for speaking practice
- Adding weekly speaking progress calendar
- Implementing empty state for new users

## Notes

- The conversation topics selected during registration are stored but not yet used in the application logic. Future tasks should implement topic-based lesson recommendations.
- The speaking goal minutes are stored in the user profile and can be used for daily goal tracking in the dashboard.
- All validation messages maintain a friendly, encouraging tone aligned with the speaking-first philosophy.
- The design maintains consistency with the existing design system while adding speaking-focused enhancements.
