# Task 18: Audio Recording Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive audio recording component using Alpine.js and the MediaRecorder API for the shadowing exercise feature. Users can now record their voice while practicing Japanese pronunciation and compare it with the original audio.

## Implementation Details

### Alpine.js Component: `audioRecorder`

Created a fully-featured audio recorder component with the following capabilities:

#### 1. Browser Compatibility Check
- Detects support for `MediaRecorder` API and `getUserMedia`
- Displays warning message if browser doesn't support recording
- Tested MIME types: `audio/webm;codecs=opus`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`

#### 2. Microphone Permission Handling
- Requests microphone permission on first recording attempt
- Configures audio constraints for optimal quality:
  - Echo cancellation enabled
  - Noise suppression enabled
  - Auto gain control enabled
- Comprehensive error handling for permission scenarios:
  - `NotAllowedError`: Permission denied by user
  - `NotFoundError`: No microphone detected
  - `NotReadableError`: Microphone in use by another app
  - Generic errors with descriptive messages

#### 3. Recording Functionality
- **Start Recording**: Initializes MediaRecorder with optimal MIME type
- **Stop Recording**: Stops recording and creates audio blob
- **Re-record**: Cleans up previous recording and starts fresh
- **Recording Timer**: Real-time display of recording duration (MM:SS format)
- **Visual Indicator**: Animated red dot during recording

#### 4. Audio Playback
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Toggle playback of recorded audio
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of playback progress
- **Auto-reset**: Returns to start when playback completes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of playback errors

#### 5. Additional Features
- **Download Recording**: Save recording as `.webm` file with timestamp
- **Recording Status**: Visual feedback (Ready/Recording/Saved)
- **Duration Display**: Shows total recording length
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio URLs and elements

### UI Components

#### Recording Controls Section
- Status indicator with color-coded states (gray/red/green)
- Recording timer with monospace font
- Action buttons:
  - Start Recording (red button with microphone icon)
  - Stop Recording (dark button with stop icon)
  - Re-record (indigo button with refresh icon)

#### Playback Section
- Appears only when recording exists
- Play/pause button with icon toggle
- Progress bar showing playback position
- Download button for saving recording
- Duration display

#### Error Messages
- Browser compatibility warning (yellow alert)
- Permission error messages (red alert)
- Contextual help text based on error type

#### Recording Tips
- Best practices for recording quality
- Guidance on environment and technique
- Styled in blue info box

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```javascript
{
  isSupported: false,           // Browser compatibility flag
  isRecording: false,           // Recording state
  isPlaying: false,             // Playback state
  permissionError: null,        // Error message string
  mediaRecorder: null,          // MediaRecorder instance
  audioChunks: [],              // Recording data chunks
  audioBlob: null,              // Final audio blob
  audioUrl: null,               // Object URL for playback
  audioElement: null,           // HTML Audio element
  recordingDuration: 0,         // Duration in seconds
  recordingTimer: null,         // Interval timer
  playbackProgress: 0           // Playback progress (0-100)
}
```

#### Key Methods
- `init()`: Check browser support
- `startRecording()`: Request permission and start recording
- `stopRecording()`: Stop recording and create blob
- `reRecord()`: Clean up and start new recording
- `togglePlayback()`: Play or pause recorded audio
- `playRecording()`: Start audio playback
- `pausePlayback()`: Pause audio playback
- `downloadRecording()`: Download audio file
- `formatTime(seconds)`: Format duration as MM:SS
- `destroy()`: Cleanup resources

### Browser Support

#### Supported Browsers
- Chrome/Edge 49+
- Firefox 25+
- Safari 14.1+
- Opera 36+

#### Unsupported Browsers
- Internet Explorer (all versions)
- Safari < 14.1
- Older mobile browsers

### User Experience

#### Recording Flow
1. User clicks "Start Recording"
2. Browser requests microphone permission (first time only)
3. Recording begins with visual indicator and timer
4. User clicks "Stop" when finished
5. Recording is saved and playback controls appear
6. User can play back, download, or re-record

#### Error Handling Flow
1. Browser compatibility checked on component init
2. Permission errors shown with specific guidance
3. Recording errors handled gracefully
4. Playback errors logged and state reset

### Accessibility Features
- Clear visual indicators for all states
- Descriptive button labels with icons
- Color-coded status messages
- Keyboard-accessible controls
- Screen reader friendly error messages

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy initialization of audio elements
- Proper cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient blob creation from chunks
- Timer cleanup on component destroy
- MediaRecorder stream cleanup after recording

### Security & Privacy
- Microphone access only requested when needed
- Permission state persisted by browser
- Recordings stored in memory (not automatically saved)
- User controls when to download recordings
- No automatic upload or external transmission

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test in supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Test permission grant/deny scenarios
3. Test recording start/stop functionality
4. Test playback controls
5. Test re-record functionality
6. Test download feature
7. Test with no microphone connected
8. Test with microphone in use by another app
9. Test recording duration timer accuracy
10. Test playback progress bar accuracy

### Edge Cases
- Recording very short clips (< 1 second)
- Recording long clips (> 5 minutes)
- Rapid start/stop cycles
- Browser tab switching during recording
- Browser refresh during recording
- Multiple recordings in same session

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.3
✅ WHEN the user enables recording mode THEN the system SHALL request microphone permission and allow recording of user's voice

### Requirement 4.4
✅ WHEN the user records their voice THEN the system SHALL save the recording and allow playback for self-comparison

## Files Modified
- `resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php`: Added complete audioRecorder Alpine.js component

## Next Steps
Task 19 will implement:
- Server-side recording storage
- UserRecording model and database records
- Secure recording retrieval
- Recording history display
- Storage management
