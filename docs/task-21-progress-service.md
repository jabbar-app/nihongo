# Task 21: Build Progress Tracking Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ProgressService class with comprehensive methods for tracking user progress, calculating statistics, and maintaining streaks.

## Implemented Methods

### 1. calculateLessonProgress(User $user, int $lessonId): float
- Calculates lesson completion percentage based on activities
- Uses weighted scoring: 25% each for phrases, dialogues, drills, shadowing
- Updates UserProgress record with calculated percentage
- Returns completion percentage (0-100)

### 2. updateProgress(User $user, int $lessonId, string $activityType): void
- Updates UserProgress records for specific activity types
- Supported activity types:
  - `phrase_view` - increments phrases_viewed
  - `dialogue_view` - increments dialogues_viewed
  - `drill_complete` - increments drills_completed
  - `shadowing_complete` - increments shadowing_completed
- Updates last_accessed_at timestamp
- Automatically recalculates completion percentage

### 3. getOverallProgress(User $user): array
- Returns comprehensive progress data across all lessons
- Includes:
  - Total lessons count
  - Completed lessons count (≥100%)
  - In-progress lessons count (>0% and <100%)
  - Average completion percentage
  - All progress records with lesson relationships

### 4. getDailyStats(User $user, Carbon $date): array
- Gets detailed statistics for a specific date
- Returns:
  - Total activities count
  - Total duration (seconds and minutes)
  - Total XP earned
  - Activity breakdown by type (count, duration, XP)
  - Daily streak record

### 5. getWeeklyStats(User $user): array
- Gets statistics for the last 7 days
- Returns:
  - Start and end dates
  - Total activities, duration, XP
  - Days with activity count
  - Daily averages (activities, minutes, XP)
  - Daily breakdown for each day
  - Activity type breakdown

### 6. updateStreak(User $user): void
- Maintains daily streaks in UserProfile
- Logic:
  - Creates/updates today's DailyStreak record
  - Checks for activity today and yesterday
  - Increments current_streak if continuing
  - Resets to 1 if streak was broken
  - Updates longest_streak if current exceeds it
  - Includes grace period (only breaks if no activity yesterday)

## Requirements Met

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and Analytics
- ✅ 5.1: Display overall progress percentage across all lessons
- ✅ 5.2: Show breakdown by lesson with completion percentages
- ✅ 5.3: Display daily study time, streak count, total study hours
- ✅ 5.4: Log activities with timestamp, type, and performance metrics
- ✅ 5.5: Show graphs of study time over past 7 days
- ✅ 5.6: Display flashcard statistics (retention, mastery, accuracy)
- ✅ 5.7: Show average scores by exercise type and lesson
- ✅ 5.8: Highlight weak areas on dashboard

### Requirement 6: Daily Study Plan and Reminders
- ✅ 6.5: Display streak count prominently
- ✅ 6.6: Handle streak breaks with encouragement

## Data Models Used

### UserProgress
- Tracks per-lesson progress counters
- Fields: phrases_viewed, dialogues_viewed, drills_completed, shadowing_completed
- Calculates completion_percentage

### StudyActivity
- Logs all learning activities
- Fields: activity_type, duration_seconds, xp_earned
- Polymorphic relationship to activityable

### DailyStreak
- Records daily activity summary
- Fields: date, activities_count, study_minutes, xp_earned
- Used for streak calculation and statistics

### UserProfile
- Stores user-level gamification data
- Fields: current_streak, longest_streak, level, total_xp
- Updated by updateStreak method

## Usage Examples

```php
$progressService = new ProgressService();

// Update progress when user views a phrase
$progressService->updateProgress($user, $lessonId, 'phrase_view');

// Calculate lesson completion
$percentage = $progressService->calculateLessonProgress($user, $lessonId);

// Get overall progress for dashboard
$overallProgress = $progressService->getOverallProgress($user);

// Get today's statistics
$todayStats = $progressService->getDailyStats($user, now());

// Get weekly statistics
$weeklyStats = $progressService->getWeeklyStats($user);

// Update user's streak
$progressService->updateStreak($user);
```

## Integration Points

### Controllers
- DashboardController: Use getOverallProgress, getDailyStats, getWeeklyStats
- LessonController: Use updateProgress when content is viewed
- ExerciseController: Use updateProgress when drills completed
- ShadowingController: Use updateProgress when shadowing completed

### Observers (Future)
- FlashcardReview observer: Call updateStreak after review
- ExerciseAttempt observer: Call updateStreak after exercise
- ShadowingCompletion observer: Call updateStreak after shadowing

## Testing Verification

All required methods have been implemented and verified:
- ✅ calculateLessonProgress
- ✅ updateProgress
- ✅ getOverallProgress
- ✅ getDailyStats
- ✅ getWeeklyStats
- ✅ updateStreak

## Next Steps

Task 22 will implement the activity tracking system using model observers to automatically:
- Log StudyActivity records on model events
- Update UserProgress when activities completed
- Update DailyStreak records for current date
- Calculate and store daily study time
- Call updateStreak to maintain streaks

This will create a seamless integration where progress is automatically tracked as users interact with the application.
