2. **app/Services/GamificationService.php** - Service for XP awards and leveling system
3. **docs/task-20-shadowing-completion.md** - Detailed implementation documentation
4. **docs/task-20-testing-guide.md** - Comprehensive testing guide

## Files Modified

1. **app/Http/Controllers/ShadowingController.php** - Added complete() method and service dependencies
2. **routes/web.php** - Added POST route for shadowing completion
3. **resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php** - Added completion form, history display, and Alpine.js component

## Key Features

### 1. Completion Tracking
- Records each shadowing practice session with duration
- Links to audio recordings when available
- Stores completion timestamp
- Associates with user and exercise

### 2. Progress Updates
- Increments shadowing_completed count in UserProgress
- Recalculates lesson completion percentage
- Updates last_accessed_at timestamp
- Uses weighted average across all activity types (25% each)

### 3. XP and Leveling
- Awards 50 XP per shadowing completion
- Checks for level ups after XP award
- Displays level up notifications
- Tracks XP in user profile

### 4. Activity Logging
- Creates StudyActivity record for each completion
- Logs activity type, duration, and XP earned
- Enables future analytics and reporting

### 5. User Interface
- **Completion Form**: Simple form to mark exercise as complete
- **Completion History**: List of all past completions with details
- **Progress Display**: Shows completion count and last practice time
- **XP Badges**: Visual feedback for XP earned
- **Recording Links**: Access to saved audio recordings

### Database Tables Used
- `shadowing_completions` - Completion records
- `study_activities` - Activity logs
- `user_progress` - Lesson progress tracking
- `user_profiles` - XP and level data

## XP System

### Rewards
- Shadowing Completion: **50 XP**
- Flashcard Review: 5 XP (defined for future use)
- Exercise Completion: 30 XP (defined for future use)
- Lesson Completion: 100 XP (defined for future use)

### Level Thresholds
| Level | XP Required |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 0           |
| 2     | 100         |
| 3     | 250         |
| 4     | 500         |
| 5     | 1,000       |
| 6     | 1,500       |
| 7     | 2,500       |
| 8     | 4,000       |
| 9     | 6,000       |
| 10    | 8,500       |

## Progress Calculation

Lesson completion is calculated using weighted averages:
- **Phrases viewed**: 25%
- **Dialogues viewed**: 25%
- **Drills completed**: 25%
- **Shadowing completed**: 25%

Formula:
```
completion_percentage = (
    (phrases_viewed / total_phrases * 0.25) +
    (dialogues_viewed / total_dialogues * 0.25) +
    (drills_completed / total_drills * 0.25) +
    (shadowing_completed / total_shadowing * 0.25)
) * 100
```

## API Endpoint

### POST /shadowing/{shadowingExercise}/complete

**Request:**
```json
{
  "duration_seconds": 900,
  "recording_id": 1  // optional
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Shadowing exercise completed!",
  "xp_earned": 50,
  "level_up": 3,  // null if no level up
  "completion": {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "shadowing_exercise_id": 1,
    "duration_seconds": 900,
    "recording_id": 1,
    "completed_at": "2025-01-10T12:00:00.000000Z",
    "recording": { /* recording object */ }
  }
}
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.5**: Track shadowing session duration and completion  
✅ **Requirement 4.7**: Update lesson progress when shadowing exercise completed  
✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Log study activities for progress tracking

## Integration Points

This implementation provides foundation for:
- **Task 21+**: Daily streak tracking
- **Task 24**: Analytics dashboard
- **Task 25+**: Achievement system
- **Task 29+**: Study plan generation

The ProgressService and GamificationService are designed to be reused by other features for consistent progress tracking and XP awards across the application.

## Testing

See `docs/task-20-testing-guide.md` for comprehensive testing instructions.

### Quick Test
1. Navigate to any shadowing exercise
2. Enter practice duration (e.g., 15 minutes)
3. Click "Mark as Complete"
4. Verify success message shows "+50 XP"
5. Check completion appears in history
6. Verify lesson progress updated

## Next Steps

With shadowing completion tracking complete, the application now has:
- ✅ Full content display system
- ✅ Flashcard system with spaced repetition
- ✅ Interactive exercises
- ✅ Audio recording and playback
- ✅ Shadowing completion tracking

**Ready for Phase 6**: Progress Tracking & Analytics
- Task 21: Build progress tracking service
- Task 22: Create activity tracking system
- Task 23: Build progress display pages
- Task 24: Create analytics dashboard

The services created in this task (ProgressService and GamificationService) will be essential for implementing the remaining progress tracking and gamification features.
