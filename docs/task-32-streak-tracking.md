# Task 32: Build Streak Tracking

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive streak tracking system with calendar visualization, streak recovery feature, and milestone achievements.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced ProgressService

Added new methods to `app/Services/ProgressService.php`:

- **`calculateStreak(User $user): int`** - Calculates current streak based on consecutive days with activity, includes grace period (one day skip allowed)
- **`canUseStreakRecovery(User $user): bool`** - Checks if user can use streak recovery (once every 30 days)
- **`useStreakRecovery(User $user): bool`** - Uses streak recovery to restore a broken streak by creating a minimal DailyStreak record for yesterday
- **`getStreakCalendar(User $user, int $days = 28): array`** - Returns calendar data for the last N days with activity information

### 2. Database Migration

Created migration `2025_10_13_041059_add_streak_recovery_to_user_profiles_table.php`:
- Added `last_streak_recovery_at` timestamp field to track when user last used streak recovery

### 3. Updated UserProfile Model

Updated `app/Models/UserProfile.php`:
- Added `last_streak_recovery_at` to fillable fields
- Added datetime cast for the new field

### 4. StreakController

Created `app/Http/Controllers/StreakController.php`:

**Methods:**
- `index()` - Display streak information, calendar, and milestones
- `recover()` - Handle streak recovery requests

**Features:**
- Shows current streak and longest streak
- Displays 28-day calendar with activity visualization
- Shows streak milestones (7, 14, 30, 60, 100, 365 days)
- Provides streak recovery option (once per 30 days)

### 5. Routes

Added to `routes/web.php`:
```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/streak', [StreakController::class, 'index'])->name('streak.index');
    Route::post('/streak/recover', [StreakController::class, 'recover'])->name('streak.recover');
});
```

### 6. Streak Index View

Created `resources/views/streak/index.blade.php`:

**Features:**
- **Streak Stats Cards:**
  - Current Streak (with fire icon)
  - Longest Streak (with star icon)
  - Streak Recovery status (with refresh icon)

- **28-Day Calendar:**
  - Visual grid showing last 28 days
  - Green gradient for active days
  - Gray for inactive days
  - Hover tooltips showing study minutes, activities, and XP

- **Streak Milestones:**
  - 7-Day Streak
  - 2-Week Streak
  - 30-Day Streak
  - 60-Day Streak
  - 100-Day Streak
  - 1-Year Streak
  - Progress bars for incomplete milestones
  - Checkmarks for achieved milestones

- **Tips Section:**
  - Helpful tips for maintaining streaks
  - Study habit recommendations

### 7. Navigation Updates

Updated `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`:
- Added "Streak" link to main navigation
- Added "Streak" link to mobile navigation

### 8. Dashboard Enhancement

Updated `resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php`:
- Made Current Streak card clickable (links to streak page)
- Added hover effect and "View details →" text
- Improved visual feedback

### 9. Gamification Integration

The existing `GamificationService` already supports streak achievements:
- Checks `current_streak` for streak-based achievements
- Awards achievements at milestones (7, 30, 100 days, etc.)
- Automatically called when streak is updated

## Features

### Streak Calculation
- Tracks consecutive days with study activity
- Includes grace period: one missed day doesn't break streak
- Updates automatically when activities are logged

### Streak Recovery
- One-time use every 30 days
- Restores broken streak by filling in yesterday's activity
- Prevents abuse with cooldown period
- Clear UI showing availability status

### Calendar Visualization
- 28-day grid view
- Color-coded days (green = active, gray = inactive)
- Hover tooltips with detailed stats
- Responsive design

### Milestone Tracking
- Predefined milestones at key intervals
- Progress bars for upcoming milestones
- Visual indicators for achieved milestones
- Integrated with achievement system

### Dashboard Integration
- Prominent streak display
- Quick access to detailed streak page
- Real-time streak count

## User Experience

### Motivation Features
1. **Visual Progress:** Calendar makes it easy to see consistency
2. **Milestone Goals:** Clear targets to work toward
3. **Recovery Safety Net:** Reduces anxiety about breaking streaks
4. **Achievement Integration:** Rewards for reaching milestones

### Accessibility
- Clear visual indicators
- Hover tooltips for additional information
- Responsive design for all devices
- Keyboard navigation support

## Technical Notes

### Grace Period Logic
The `calculateStreak()` method allows one missed day without breaking the streak:
```php
if (!$hasActivity) {
    if (!$gracePeriodUsed && $streak > 0) {
        $gracePeriodUsed = true;
        $currentDate->subDay();
        continue;
    }
    break;
}
```

### Streak Recovery Cooldown
Prevents abuse by enforcing 30-day cooldown:
```php
if (!$lastRecovery) {
    return true;
}
return $lastRecovery->diffInDays(now()) >= 30;
```

### Calendar Data Structure
Returns array with detailed information for each day:
```php
[
    'date' => '2025-10-13',
    'day' => 'Mon',
    'dayNumber' => '13',
    'hasActivity' => true,
    'activities_count' => 5,
    'study_minutes' => 45,
    'xp_earned' => 250,
]
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Streak Calculation:**
   - Test consecutive days
   - Test grace period (one missed day)
   - Test streak reset after two missed days

2. **Streak Recovery:**
   - Test recovery functionality
   - Test cooldown period enforcement
   - Test UI state changes

3. **Calendar Display:**
   - Test with various streak lengths
   - Test hover interactions
   - Test responsive layout

4. **Milestone Progress:**
   - Test progress calculations
   - Test achievement integration
   - Test visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extended Calendar:** Option to view more than 28 days
2. **Streak Freeze:** Allow users to "freeze" streak for planned breaks
3. **Social Features:** Share streak achievements
4. **Streak Challenges:** Compete with friends
5. **Custom Milestones:** User-defined streak goals
6. **Streak Insights:** Analysis of best study times and patterns

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 6.5: Streak count displayed prominently on dashboard
- ✅ 6.6: Streak broken if day missed (with grace period)
- ✅ 7.7: Streak milestone achievements awarded
