# Task 19 Implementation Summary

## Recording Storage and Playback

### Completed Features

#### 1. Backend Implementation

**RecordingController** (`app/Http/Controllers/RecordingController.php`)
- `store()` - Upload and save recordings with validation
- `serve()` - Securely serve recordings to authenticated users
- `destroy()` - Delete recordings with authorization check
- `storageUsage()` - Get user's storage statistics

**AudioService Updates** (`app/Services/AudioService.php`)
- Enhanced `storeRecording()` to accept duration parameter
- Added `getUserStorageUsage()` for storage tracking
- Existing `getRecordingUrl()` and `deleteRecording()` methods

**Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
- `POST /recordings` - Store new recording
- `GET /recordings/{recording}` - Serve recording file
- `DELETE /recordings/{recording}` - Delete recording
- `GET /recordings-usage` - Get storage usage

**Configuration** (`config/filesystems.php`)
- Added 'private' disk configuration for secure storage

#### 2. Frontend Implementation

**Shadowing Exercise Page** (`resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php`)

**Recording Controls:**
- Save button to upload recording to server
- Loading state during save operation
- Success/error messages for user feedback

**Practice History Section:**
- Display all user's past recordings
- Show recording date, time, and duration
- Play button for inline audio playback
- Download button for offline access
- Delete button with confirmation dialog

**Alpine.js Component Updates:**
- Added `isSaving`, `saveSuccess`, `saveError` state
- Implemented `saveRecording()` method with FormData upload
- Added global `playRecording()` function
- Added global `deleteRecording()` function with confirmation

#### 3. Security Features

- Authentication required for all recording operations
- Authorization check - users can only access their own recordings
- File validation (type, size, MIME type)
- Files stored outside public directory
- CSRF protection on all mutations

#### 4. Storage Management

- Recordings stored in `storage/app/private/recordings/{user_id}/`
- Metadata tracked in `user_recordings` table
- Storage usage calculation (bytes and MB)
- File cleanup on deletion

### Technical Details

**File Upload:**
- Accepts: webm, mp4, ogg, wav, mp3
- Max size: 10MB
- Stored with unique filenames

**Database:**
- Uses existing `user_recordings` table
- Polymorphic relationship (recordable_type, recordable_id)
- Tracks duration, timestamps, file path

**User Experience:**
- Seamless save workflow
- Immediate feedback on actions
- Page reload after save to show new recording
- Confirmation before deletion

### Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/RecordingController.php`
- `docs/task-19-recording-storage.md`
- `docs/task-19-summary.md`

**Modified:**
- `app/Services/AudioService.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/ShadowingController.php`
- `routes/web.php`
- `config/filesystems.php`
- `resources/views/shadowing/show.blade.php`

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Audio recording with microphone permission and recording functionality
✅ **Requirement 4.4**: Save recorded audio and allow playback for self-comparison
✅ **Requirement 4.5**: Track shadowing session duration and link to recording

### Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Users can now:
1. Record their shadowing practice
2. Save recordings to the server
3. View their practice history
4. Play back previous recordings
5. Download recordings for offline use
6. Delete old recordings

### Manual Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to any shadowing exercise
2. Click "Start Recording" and allow microphone access
3. Record for a few seconds and click "Stop"
4. Click "Save" to upload the recording
5. Verify the recording appears in "Your Practice History"
6. Click play to test playback
7. Click download to test file download
8. Click delete and confirm to test deletion

All functionality has been implemented according to the task requirements.
