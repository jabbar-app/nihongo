# Task 29: Study Plan Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented the StudyPlanService class that generates personalized daily study plans based on user goals and progress.

## Components Created

### 1. StudyPlanService (`app/Services/StudyPlanService.php`)

#### Key Methods:

**`generateDailyPlan(User $user, Carbon $date): DailyPlan`**
- Generates a complete daily study plan for the specified date
- Checks if a plan already exists to avoid duplicates
- Creates user profile with defaults if it doesn't exist
- Calls `getRecommendedActivities()` to build the activity list
- Calculates total estimated time
- Stores plan in DailyPlan model with all activities

**`getRecommendedActivities(User $user): array`**
- Analyzes user's current progress and goals
- Returns a prioritized list of recommended activities
- Activity types included:
  1. **Flashcard Reviews** (Priority 1) - Due cards that need review
  2. **New Flashcards** (Priority 2) - New cards to learn based on daily goal
  3. **New Content** (Priority 3) - Next incomplete lesson to study
  4. **Practice Exercises** (Priority 4) - Drills from lessons in progress
  5. **Shadowing Practice** (Priority 5) - Shadowing exercises from lessons in progress

**Helper Methods:**
- `getNextLessonToStudy(User $user)` - Finds the next lesson that's not 100% complete
- `getLessonsInProgress(User $user)` - Returns lessons that are started but not finished
- `getIncompleteDrills(User $user, Lesson $lesson)` - Counts remaining drills for a lesson
- `getIncompleteShadowing(User $user, Lesson $lesson)` - Counts remaining shadowing exercises

## Activity Structure

Each activity in the plan contains:
```php
[
    'id' => 'unique_identifier',           // e.g., 'flashcard_review', 'lesson_1'
    'type' => 'activity_type',             // flashcard_review, content_view, exercise, shadowing
    'title' => 'Display Title',            // User-friendly title
    'description' => 'Details',            // Description of what to do
    'estimated_minutes' => 20,             // Time estimate
    'target_count' => 10,                  // Optional: number of items (cards, drills, etc.)
    'lesson_id' => 1,                      // Optional: related lesson ID
    'priority' => 1,                       // Priority order (1 = highest)
    'completed' => false,                  // Completion status
]
```

## Time Estimation Logic

- **Flashcard Reviews**: ~30 seconds per card (max 30 minutes)
- **New Flashcards**: ~1 minute per card (learning takes longer)
- **Content View**: 20-30 minutes per lesson
- **Drills**: ~5 minutes per drill (max 25 minutes)
- **Shadowing**: ~5 minutes per exercise (max 20 minutes)

## Plan Data Structure

The DailyPlan model stores:
```php
[
    'activities' => [...],                  // Array of activity objects
    'estimated_total_minutes' => 95,        // Sum of all activity times
    'goal_minutes' => 120,                  // User's daily goal
]
```

## Smart Recommendations

The service intelligently recommends activities by:

1. **Prioritizing due flashcards** - Reviews are most important for retention
2. **Balancing new and review content** - Respects user's cards_per_day_goal
3. **Progressive learning** - Suggests next lesson in sequence
4. **Completing started lessons** - Focuses on lessons in progress before moving on
5. **Varied practice** - Includes different activity types (reading, listening, speaking)
6. **Time-aware** - Estimates fit within user's study_goal_minutes

## Fallback Behavior

If user has no progress yet:
- Suggests starting the first lesson
- Provides a welcoming message to begin the learning journey

## Integration Points

The service integrates with:
- **UserProfile** - Gets study goals (study_goal_minutes, cards_per_day_goal)
- **Flashcard** - Checks due and new cards using scopes
- **Lesson** - Finds next lessons to study
- **UserProgress** - Tracks completion percentages
- **ExerciseAttempt** - Identifies completed drills
- **ShadowingCompletion** - Identifies completed shadowing exercises

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **6.1** - Generates plan based on user goals (study_goal_minutes, cards_per_day_goal)
✅ **6.2** - Provides recommended activities considering user progress
✅ **6.7** - Creates balanced plan with flashcards, new content, exercises, and shadowing

## Next Steps

Task 30 will implement:
- StudyPlanController to display the plan
- UI for viewing and completing activities
- Progress tracking as activities are completed
- Daily plan completion celebration

## Testing Recommendations

Test scenarios:
1. New user with no progress - should suggest first lesson
2. User with due flashcards - should prioritize reviews
3. User with lessons in progress - should suggest drills and shadowing
4. User who completed all lessons - should handle gracefully
5. Different study goals - should adjust recommendations accordingly
