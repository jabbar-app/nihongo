# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Japanese language learning web application built with Laravel. The application will serve as the primary learning tool for users who want to achieve conversational fluency in Japanese as quickly as possible through intensive, full-time study. The app leverages existing structured content (phrases, dialogues, drills, and shadowing exercises) across 9 thematic lessons and provides an engaging, effective learning experience through spaced repetition, active practice, progress tracking, and gamification.

The application must be self-contained, eliminating the need for external apps while supporting various learning modalities: reading, listening, speaking practice, and interactive exercises.
