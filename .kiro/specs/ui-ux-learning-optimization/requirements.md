# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the UI/UX of the Nihongo language learning application to create a more engaging, intuitive, and conversation-focused learning experience. The improvements will prioritize the landing page, login/register pages, lessons page, and related learning interfaces. The goal is to align the visual design, copywriting, and user flow with speaking-first language learning pedagogy, making the app feel like a dedicated conversation and speaking practice platform rather than a generic web application.

The app's core philosophy is learning Japanese through speaking and real conversations, emphasizing:
- Dialogue practice and shadowing exercises
- Audio-first learning with native pronunciation
- Real-world conversational scenarios
- Speaking confidence building

Key areas of improvement include:
- Speaking-focused copywriting that emphasizes conversation skills
- Visual hierarchy that highlights audio exercises and speaking practice
- Streamlined user flows that prioritize speaking activities
- Japanese language and culture integration in design elements
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for on-the-go speaking practice
- Accessibility improvements for audio-based learning
